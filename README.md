## Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) Chess Game
- Andreas Johnson
- Isaac Mount

# Instructions for Running Application
First, you will need to install [Unity](https://unity.com/).
Guides for this can be found on their website, as well as in various locations online.

Next, clone this repo into a convenient location on your PC.
Ensure that all required additional packages and modules are installed for Unity, including Android/iOS build support (depending on the device you wish to use) and the following packages:
- AR Foundation
- ARCore XR Plugin (for iOS)
- ARKit XR Plugin (for Android)

The AR rendering has not been tested on mobile devices, yet, and may not function as expected.
To test the project without AR, simply open the project in Unity, then click the "play" button.
To move pieces, select the piece to move from the scene hierarchy panel (left panel by default).
Then, using the inspector (right panel by default), you can view the current details of the piece, as well as manually enter a move for the piece.

For example, selecting `Board/WhitePieces/Pawns/E`, you could enter `e4` in the inspector panel for the field `Move Position`.
Then, the move will be rendered in the game window.
Note that currently, move captures are not supported, nor are the positions entered in `Move Position` checked for *legality* (though they are checked to ensure the position exists on the board).

In the inspector panel, you can also view the `Possible Moves` field, which lists the *legal* moves for each piece.
This is not yet implemented for the queen piece, and does not include some special rules such as taking En Passant.
Pins have limited support, but currently do not update accurately.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore how interfaces can affect users' cognitive performance.
Chess offers an ideal task for testing this, being widely available in many interfaces.
We will be testing a tangible augmented reality (TAR) interface and a digital interface.
This repo is the code base for the TAR version of chess, while the digital version will be played on Chess.com.

The end goal for this repo is to have a TAR chess application which recognizes a player's moves on a physical board, while rendering the moves from a digital opponent via the AR pieces.
This will primarily be built for iOS, but future builds could include Android.

## Current Progress
- [ ] Rendering of pieces
  - [x] basic piece and board rendering
  - [ ] only renders opponents' pieces (in progress)
  - [ ] occlusion (may not be implemented)
- [x] Piece move scripting
  - [x] animations
  - [x] pawns
  - [x] kings
  - [x] rooks
  - [x] knights
  - [x] bishops
  - [x] queens
- [ ] `Board` scripting
  - [x] piece positions
  - [x] attacks on tiles
  - [ ] checks & checkmates (in progress)
  - [ ] stalemates
  - [ ] pins on pieces
  - [x] castling
  - [x] captures (in progress)
  - [ ] en passant captures
  - [ ] pawn promotions
- [ ] Computer Vision (may not be implemented)
  - [ ] recognizes pieces
  - [ ] recognizes moves
  - [ ] checks for captures on player's pieces
  - [ ] highlights legal move tiles when player picks up piece

The reason computer vision is marked as "may not be implemented" is due to the scope of the project.
If time permits, we will integrate computer vision into the application; however, if this is not the case, we may need to implement a developer interface which sidesteps the computer vision aspect.
This would be the "Wizard of Oz" solution, in which we would tell the experiment's participants that the application recognizes their moves, while in reality the experimenters would be manually entering the participant's moves.
This will already be done for the chess engine's moves, so the interface for the experimenters will already be present.

We will use the 3D models & materials for a chess set and board for rendering in the AR application.

A chess analysis toolkit which we will use to generate engine moves to play against participants.
We will also use this software to analyze games for particpants' cognitive performance.
