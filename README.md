## Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) Chess Game

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore how interfaces can affect users' cognitive performance.
Chess offers an ideal task for testing this, being widely available in many interfaces.
We will be testing a tangible augmented reality (TAR) interface and a digital interface.
This repo is the code base for the TAR version of chess, while the digital version will be played on Chess.com.

The end goal for this repo is to have a TAR chess application which recognizes a player's moves on a physical board, while rendering the moves from a digital opponent via the AR pieces.
This will primarily be built for iOS, but future builds could include Android.

## Current Progress

  - [x] pawns
  - [ ] kings
  - [ ] rooks
  - [ ] knights
  - [ ] bishops
  - [ ] queens
- [ ] Board scripting
  - [x] piece positions
  - [ ] checks & checkmates
  - [x] pins on pieces
  - [x] attacks on tiles (for recognizing illegal king movement)
  - [ ] captures
  - [ ] en passant captures
  - [ ] pawn promotions
- [ ] Computer Vision
  - [ ] recognizes pieces

We will use the 3D models & materials for a chess set and board for rendering in the AR application.

## Other Software
### [Lucas Chess](https://lucaschess.pythonanywhere.com/) by [lukasmonk](https://github.com/lukasmonk) ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lukasmonk/lucaschess))
A chess analysis toolkit which we will use to generate engine moves to play against participants.
We will also use this software to analyze games for particpants' cognitive performance.
